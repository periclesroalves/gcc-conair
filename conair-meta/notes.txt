- TODO: Document pass in trunk/gcc/doc/invoke.texi
- TODO: Remember to verify tods for after pass (e.g., clean_ssa, which requires
  marking new names to be done).

- I coudn't find a way to verify if a function comes from a library, so I wasn't
  able to verify if the user may have overwritten functions like __assert_rtn
  and pthreads_lock.
   . Since this coudn't be verified, newly inserted assertion failure block will
   have the original dereference block as a successor, as the user may redefine
   __assert_rtn or __assert_fail not to exit.
  TODO: currently we implement assertion failures as calls to __builtin_trap.
  However, the original assert() does nothing when NDEBUG is defined, and so
  should our implementaation.

- I assume that every pointer dereference is represented as the rhs or lhs of a
  single rhs assignment. In other stages of the CFG this may not be true. Other
  than that, the dereferenced address must be hold by an SSA name, so that we
  can safely test it before the actual dereference (no side effect garanteed).
  TODO: In addition, we must consider builtin functions that may dereference an
    argument: maybe handle them by hand.

- TODO: improve graph-check to verify the existence of assertion failure calls
  (maybe create one version of pointer testing for output testing and another
  for segfault avoidance testing).
